# diadmin - SAP Data Intelligence Admin Tools 

Commandline tool with Python packages that helps me to run my operation tasks for the SAP Data Intelligence Cloud instances. Most of the commands use vctl and some official RestAPIs ([SAP API Data Hub](https://api.sap.com/package/SAPDataIntelligenceCloud/overview)) and unoffical RestAPIs.

**Attention**: This is a private and unsupported solution. Of course I am happy to get hints on bugs and try to solve them. 

## Pre-requiste 
System Management Command-line of SAP Data Intelligence (vctl)

Download: [SAP Download Center](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/softwarecenter/template/products/%20_APP=00200682500000001943&_EVENT=DISPHIER&HEADER=Y&FUNCTIONBAR=N&EVENT=TREE&NE=NAVIGATE&ENR=73554900100800002981&V=INST&TA=ACTUAL&PAGE=SEARCH/DATA%20INTELLIGENCE-SYS%20MGMT%20CLI). 


## Installation

```
pip diadmin
```

## Summary

### Commandline

All commands use a configuration yaml-file (option: --config) that at least needs the URL and the credentials of the SAP Data Intelligence system:

```
TENANT: default
URL: https://vsystem.ingress.xxx.shoot.live.k8s-hana.ondemand.com
USER: user
PWD: pwd123
```
Some commands need more configuration parameters. Each command comes with a help option (--help)

### Packages

- **dimockapi** Creating script templates based on operator.json and configSchema.json and a test-script for offline testing. In addtion it contains a mock_api package.
- **metadata_api** Using the metadata RestAPIs of SAP API Business Hub 
- **utils** Collection of helper functions
- **vctl_cmds** Python wrapper around vctl-commands
- **analysis** For analysing the policy data

## Details 

### dipolicy 

Command line script that supports admin tasks regarding policy managment, like 

- **diupload**: uploading development artifacts (operators, graphs, dockerfiles, menus, solutions)
- **didownload**: downloading development artifacts (operators, graphs, dockerfiles, menus, solutions)
* analyses policy dependency and producing a 
  * csv-file of policy resources
  * visualizes  policy network
* export and import policies
* build docker images in user workspaces
* creating user in Data Intelligence system with defined roles/policies
* monitors pipelines
* creates a custom operator script framework using config.json and operatorSchema.json

Reads policy data from SAP Data Intelligence and provides a policy network, chart and a resources.csv file for further analysis.

```
usage: dipolicy [-h] [-c CONFIG] [-g] [-d DOWNLOAD] [-u UPLOAD] [-f FILE] [-a]

"Policy utility script for SAP Data Intelligence. Pre-requiste: vctl. "

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c CONFIG, --config CONFIG
                        Specifies yaml-config file
  -g, --generate        Generates config.yaml file
  -d DOWNLOAD, --download DOWNLOAD
                        Downloads specified policy. If 'all' then all policies are download
  -u UPLOAD, --upload UPLOAD
                        Uploads new policy.
  -f FILE, --file FILE  File to analyse policy structure. If not given all policies are newly downloaded.
  -a, --analyse         Analyses the policy structure. Resource list is saved as 'resources.csv'.

```

### dipmonitor

List of pipelines user has started recently. Needs a config.yaml with SAP Data Intelligence credentials:

```
URL : 'https://vsystem.ingress.myinstance.ondemand.com'
TENANT: 'default'
USER : 'user'
PWD : 'pwd123'
```


### didownload - part of diadmin

Downloads SAP Data Intelligence artifacts 

* operators
* pipelines
* Dockerfiles

to local files systems in order to be offline modified or tested (operators) or using a local git implementation for a version control. The script as to started from the root folder of the project that has the following structure: 

project/ 
* operators/
  * package/
    * (optional) subpackage/
      * operator/
        * operator-files
        * ...
* pipelines
  * package/
    * pipeline/
      * pipeline-file with sub-folders
* dockerfiles
  * name of dockerfile
    * Dockerfile
    * Tags.json

In the root folder a config.yaml file is needed. With the option ```--config``` you can specify which config-file should be used in case e.g. you work with different user or SAP Data Intelligence instances. The basic parameters of config.yaml are

```
URL : 'https://vsystem.ingress.myinstance.ondemand.com'
TENANT: 'default'
USER : 'user'
PWD : 'pwd123'

```

The ```--help``` option describes the additional options
```
